The instances and results are presented here.
Specifically, these instances are generated from actual production data.
In the instance files, there are four vectors representing height grade, item's width, item's length and item's demand, respectively.
In the result files, we have uploaded the iteration process and the computational results of column generation (CG) algorithm and accelerated column generation (ACG) algorithm.
For the mixed integer program (MIP), we have uploaded the CPLEX log files for the corresponding instances.
The results of height combination are presented in the height combination files.
